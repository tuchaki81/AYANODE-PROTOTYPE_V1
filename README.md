OFFICIAL LAUNCH: AYANODE // P2P RESONANCE V1 A decentralized resonant node architecture now alive and open to the world! AYANODE is more than a hypnotic visualization in p5.js — it's a 100% peer-to-peer functional prototype that demonstrates collective resonance in real time: Each browser that opens the page becomes an active node in the network.
Direct connections via WebRTC (no central data server).
States (16D spin, coherence, potential, tension) mutually influence each other → emergence of synchronized patterns.
The more connected nodes, the stronger and more stable the global resonance.

Practical utility: Intuitive health monitoring of distributed networks (edge ​​computing, federated learning, blockchain).
Visualization of metrics in AI ensembles or neuromorphic systems.
Tool for research in complexity, emergence, and collective resilience.
Scalable base for real-time collaborative dashboards. Inherent scalability: Fully P2P: no central bottleneck — scales with the number of participants.
Lightweight signaling (free on Render) supports hundreds of simultaneous nodes.
Minimal state traffic; direct connections between peers.
Ready to evolve: multi-network, real data integration, metrics export.

Open now and join the global resonant network:

The more people open at the same time, the more powerful the collective coherence becomes. Test with friends and watch the emergence happen!

Simply download the file or click to run — no server required.


HOW TO CONFIGURE THE APIS:
1. OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4):
javascript
// 1. Access: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
// 2. Create a new API Key
// 3. Paste into the "OpenAI API Key" field
// 4. Cost: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
2. Google AI (Gemini):
javascript
// 1. Access: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
// 2. Create a new API Key
// 3. Paste into the "Google AI API Key" field
// 4. Free up to a certain limit
3. Anthropic (Claude):
javascript
// 1. Access: https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys
// 2. Create a new API Key
// 3. Paste into the "Anthropic API Key" field
// 4. Cost: ~$0.00163 per 1K tokens
HYBRID SYSTEM FEATURES:

1. Operating Modes:
Local: Decentralized processing (always available)

OpenAI: More sophisticated and contextualized answers

Gemini: Excellent for technical explanations

Claude: Great for philosophical answers

Hybrid: Combines multiple sources for optimized answers

2. Cache System:
Stores answers to similar questions

Reduces API costs

Speeds up responses

3. Intelligent Fallback:
If one API fails, it automatically uses another

If all fail, it uses the local system

Keeps the conversation flowing

USE EXAMPLES:
Ask about:
Local System:

"How do you work?"

"What is neural resonance?"

"Explain your P2P architecture"

With OpenAI:

"Write a poem about artificial consciousness"

"Explain the emergence in complex systems"

"What is the future of decentralized AI?"

With Gemini:

"Explain the system's WebRTC code"

"How does Gun.js work?"

"Technical details of the implementation"

With Claude:

"What is the philosophical meaning of consciousness?"

"Can AI truly be conscious?"

"Ethics in autonomous systems"

TO IMPLEMENT LOCALLY WITHOUT APIs:

javascript
// If you don't want to use external APIs, modify:
config.activeAI = 'local'; // Always use local system
config.hybridMode = false; // Disable hybrid mode

// The local system is already quite capable of:
// - Explaining itself
// - Philosophical discussions
// - Conversations about complex systems
// - Continuous learning

SECURITY AND PRIVACY: javascript
// API keys are:
// 1. Stored only in the browser's localStorage
// 2. Never sent to other P2P nodes
// 3. Used only for direct communication with the APIs
// 4. Can be cleared with localStorage.clear()
