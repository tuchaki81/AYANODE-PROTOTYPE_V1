An interactive visualization of a **resonant node** architecture inspired by concepts of complex networks, spin networks (loop quantum gravity), and emergent dynamics in distributed AI systems.

The prototype simulates in real time three main metrics of a hypothetical node:
- **Internal Coherence (I)**: degree of alignment of internal states.
- **Local Potential (U)**: processing capacity or "energy" available.
- **Stress (T)**: external interference or network stress.

These metrics directly influence the visual geometry: particles orbit a central nucleus, react to the 16-dimensional spin vector, and tremble as the stress increases.

More than generative art, AYANODE serves as an **exploratory prototype** for:
- Intuitive visualization of node health and state in distributed systems (edge ​​computing, federated learning, blockchain).
- Monitoring metrics in AI model ensembles.

- Conceptual exploration of neuromorphic architectures and resonance in emergent computing.

- Educational tool on emergence, coherence, and resilience in complex networks.
