OFFICIAL LAUNCH: AYANODE // P2P RESONANCE V2.0 A decentralized resonant node architecture now alive and open to the world! AYANODE is more than a hypnotic visualization in p5.js — it's a 100% peer-to-peer functional prototype that demonstrates collective resonance in real time: Each browser that opens the page becomes an active node in the network.
Direct connections via WebRTC (no central data server).
States (16D spin, coherence, potential, tension) mutually influence each other → emergence of synchronized patterns.
The more connected nodes, the stronger and more stable the global resonance.

Practical utility: Intuitive health monitoring of distributed networks (edge ​​computing, federated learning, blockchain).
Visualization of metrics in AI ensembles or neuromorphic systems.
Tool for research in complexity, emergence, and collective resilience.
Scalable base for real-time collaborative dashboards. Inherent scalability: Fully P2P: no central bottleneck — scales with the number of participants.
Lightweight signaling (free on Render) supports hundreds of simultaneous nodes.
Minimal state traffic; direct connections between peers.
Ready to evolve: multi-network, real data integration, metrics export.

Open now and join the global resonant network:

The more people open at the same time, the more powerful the collective coherence becomes. Test with friends and watch the emergence happen!
